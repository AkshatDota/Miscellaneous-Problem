    "A ceremony where a Bride chooses her Groom from an array of eligible bachelors is called Swayamvar. But this is a Swayamvar with difference. An array of Bride-to-be will choose from an array of Groom-to-be.\n",

    "\n",
    "· If the most eligible bachelorette passes the most eligible bachelor, the most eligible bachelor now moves to the end of the queue. The next most eligible bachelor is now considered by the most eligible bachelorette. Selection or Passing over will have the same consequences as explained earlier.\n",

    "· If most eligible bachelorette reaches the end of bachelor queue, then the Swayamvar is over. Nobody can get married.\n",

    "## Grooving Monkeys\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "N monkeys are invited to a party where they start dancing. They dance in a circular formation, very similar to a Gujarati Garba or a Drum Circle. The dance requires the monkeys to constantly change positions after every 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change of position is not random & you, in the audience, observe a pattern. Monkeys are very disciplined & follow a specific pattern while dancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider N = 6, and an array monkeys = {3,6,5,4,1,2}.\n",
    "\n",
    "This array (1-indexed) is the dancing pattern. The value at monkeys[i], indicates the new of position of the monkey who is standing at the ith position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given N & the array monkeys[ ], find the time after which all monkeys are in the initial positions for the 1st time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "1<=t<=10 (test cases)\n",
    "\n",
    "1<=N<=10000 (Number of monkeys)\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "First line contains single integer t, denoting the number of test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each test case is as follows -\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer N denoting the number of monkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next line contains N integer denoting the dancing pattern array, monkeys[].\n",
    "Output\n",
    "\n",
    "t lines,\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line must contain a single integer T, where T is the minimum number of seconds after which all the monkeys are in their initial position.\n",

    "a will move to 3rd position, b will move to 6th position, c will move to 5th position, d will move to 4th position, e will move to 1st position and f will move to 2nd position. Thus from a,b,c,d,e,f at t =0, we get e,f,a,d,c,b at t =1. Recursively applying same transpositions, we get following positions for different values of t.\n",
